# Pocket Plays (Google-less Fork)

This is a fork of the [Pocket Plays for Twitch](https://github.com/SebastianRask/Pocket-Plays-for-Twitch) Android application.

It differs in these basic ways:

- No Google Play services reliance. This means Chromecast support is gone.
- Google Analytics stripped out.
- Crashlytics stripped out.
- Doesn't leak OAuth access token to random parked domain
- Notification support removed
- Donation prompt removed (if you like, install the original and donate to the author that way, they deserve it)
- Made a few mb leaner by stripping unused resources
- Enforces TLS for chat connections
- Support global and channel badges (e.g. subscription streaks)

It is not published on any app stores.

## [Here Be Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_be_dragons)

Pocket Plays started as an Android learning project on my first semester of Computer Science. 
This means that quite a bit of the program has high coupling, low coherence and generally poorly written and structured code.  
This will surely impact the way you navigate, understand and maybe contribute to the project. 

I've done my best to rewrite the worst parts before making Pocket Plays open source.
